# vMenu-txadminRecipe
Complete RP Server For FiveM based on vMenu, & Badger's Ace Perms.

## What is with all these other .cfg files?
These .cfg files were created, to make the server.cfg file be clean, and refrain it from getting cluttered up from EasyAdmin permission's, adding in resources, and much more. We want to to have our server.cfg clean as much as possible, for easier configuration and not having to constantly search for something you are looking for whether if it's in server.cfg, resources.cfg, etc. keeping it neat and clean.

## How do I setup EasyAdmin?
To setup EasyAdmin, please read the [easyadmin_setup.md](https://github.com/PeEcEeChIP/vMenu-txadminRecipe/blob/main/easyadmin_setup.md) to see how you can configure your EasyAdmin, and setup permissions.
